// Observer Design Pattern
// -----------------------

// Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a
// subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any
// events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

// Problem:
// Imagine that you have a blog engine that allows users to
// subscribe to your blog and receive notifications when you
// publish a new post. The blog engine is a subject, and the
// users are observers. When a new post is published, the blog
// engine notifies all subscribed users about it.

// The Observer Pattern provides a subscription mechanism
// that lets multiple objects subscribe to an event and get
// notified when the event occurs.

// The Observer Pattern is also known as the Publish-Subscribe

/**
 * Observable class that can be used to subscribe to events.
 * @description The observer pattern is a design pattern in which an object, called the subject,
 *              maintains a list of its dependents, called observers,
 *              and notifies them automatically of any state changes,
 *              typically by calling one of their methods.
