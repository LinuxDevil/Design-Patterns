# Command pattern
# ----------------

# The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern
# in which an object is used to encapsulate all
# information needed to perform an action or trigger
# an event at a later time. This information includes
# the method name, the object that owns the method and
# values for the method parameters.

# It's a behavioral design pattern that turns a request
# into a stand-alone object that contains all information
# about the request. This transformation lets you pass
# requests as a method arguments, delay or queue
# a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

# Problem:
# --------
# imagine a system that processes
# orders from an e-commerce website. When a new order
# is received, the system needs to perform various tasks,
# such as updating inventory, sending notifications, 
# and charging the customer's payment method. Each of these 
# tasks can be encapsulated in a Command object, which can be 
# executed by an Invoker object in response to a corresponding event.

# Invoker 
class OrderProcessor
  def initialize
    @commands = []

  def add_command(command)

    @notification_service.send_notification(@order.customer_email, "Your order has been received!")
  end

class ChargePaymentCommand < OrderCommand
  def initialize(payment_gateway, order)
    @payment_gateway = payment_gateway
    @order = order

    # charge payment method based on order details
    @payment_gateway.charge_customer(@order.customer_id, @order.total_amount)
